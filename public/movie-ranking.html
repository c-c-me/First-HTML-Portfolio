<h1>My Favorite Movies... That I can think of right now</h1>
<h2>Listing 5 to start</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Beetlejuice</h3>
<p>Timeless movie. Anyone who disagrees is wrong.</p>
<h3>Ocean's 12</h3>
<p>Ocean's 11 is amazing, but I just like the sense of wanderlust the sequel brings to the series.</p>
<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>I've seen this probably over a dozen times and it hasn't gotten old. Something I didn't even notice the first couple of times watching was that the main character DOES NOT HAVE A NAME!</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Bea....UTIFUL!</p>
<h3>James Bond: Casino Royale</h3>
<p>Amazing refresh of an iconic character - giving a more realistic perspective on the life of a spy. Grit, playing with death, and staying loyal to your nation.</p>
